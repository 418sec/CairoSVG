CairoSVG 0.5
============

CairoSVG 0.4 has been released, with exciting new features and a lot of
bugfixes:

* Simple support of the ``image`` tag thanks to pystacia
* Better tests with pystacia instead of pypng (~35% faster)
* Handle s after C/S and S after c/s in paths
* Handle rounded corners with 2 different radii for rectangles
* Fix python 2.6 support
* Fix markers with empty paths and z/Z points
* Fix initial m in paths with no current point
* Fix transformations order

Don't expect new features before the next 1.0 version: only documentation and
bugfixes are expected during the next weeks.
