Road to CairoSVG 1.0
====================

Now that CairoSVG has a quite stable API and a lot of features, it's time to
release a stable version, isn't it?

So, here's the road between 0.3 and 1.0:

- Percentages, em and ex units (done);
- Real opacity for groups (done);
- Character rotations;
- Better tests.

The two missing items need a lot of time:

- The ``text`` module must be totally rewritten to correctly handle paths,
  letter spacing and rotation;
- New tests must include unit tests (even included in the docstrings for some
  helpers), simple SVG files (to test one specific feature) and complex SVG
  files.
