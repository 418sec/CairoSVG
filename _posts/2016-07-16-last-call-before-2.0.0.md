CairoSVG 2.0.0rc4 has been released today and may be the last release canditate
before 2.0.0. It's time to test and check that everything is OK for you, dear
users and developers of CairoSVG!

2.0.0 is a new major version, its changelog includes:

* Drop Python 2 support.
* Drop pycairo support.
* Rely on cairocffi, lxml, cssselect, pillow and tinycss.
* Fix markers.
* Fix URL/id handling.
* Use bounding boxes for gradients.
* Split deployment and development tests.
* Test with Travis.

I'd also like to thank the people who took some time to report issues, fix bugs
and add new features. Your tireless help is really appreciated!
