External SVG
============

- ``conform-viewers-02-f``

This test doesn't pass because of the gzipped SVG data included in the data
URI.


Tag ``image``
=============

- ``coords-viewattr-04-f``
- ``struct-image-*``
- ``struct-symbol-01-b``
- ``render-groups-*``

These test doesn't pass because the ``image`` tag is not handled correctly.
