 Mask

`Clipping, masking and compositing <http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/masking.html>`_ is
not handled at all, but it seems quite easy to make some of these tests
work as equivalent features are available in Cairo. If you want to write some
easy code and be remembered as *The one who added masks in CairoSVG*, you
definitely are in the right folder to start your work.
